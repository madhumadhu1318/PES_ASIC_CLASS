# Introduction
### Flow : HLL -> ALP -> Binary -> (HDL) -> GDS
#### 1. HLL -> High level language (c , c++) 
- A high-level programming language is a type of programming language that is designed to be more human-readable and user-friendly compared to low-level languages like assembly or machine code.

#### 2. ALP -> Assembly level program
- Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to the architecture of a specific computer's central processing unit (CPU). Assembly language programs are written using mnemonic codes that represent specific machine instructions which the machine can understand.

#### 3. HDL -> Hardware Description Language
- It is a specialized programming language used for designing and describing digital hardware circuits. HDLs allow engineers to model and simulate complex digital systems before physical implementation, aiding in the design and verification of integrated circuits and FPGA configurations.
- Verilog, System Verilog, VHDL

#### 4. GDS -> Graphic Data System (layout)
- Format used in the semiconductor industry to represent the layout and design of integrated circuits at a highly detailed level. GDSII files contain information about the geometric shapes, layers, masks, and other essential details that make up the physical layout of a chip.
- Tools : Klayout, Magic

##### The Hardware needs to understand what the Application software is saying it to do.This relation can be eshtablished by System Software

____System Software____
- OS : Operating System : Handles IO, memory allocation, Low level system function
- Compiler : Convert the input to hardware dependent instruction
- Assembler : Convert the instructions provided by compiler to Binary format
- HDL : A program that understands the Binary pattern and map it to a netlist
- GDS : Layout

## Introduction to Risc-v Basic Keywords
- **Instruction Set Architecture(ISA)**
  - An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) refers to the set of instructions that a computer's central processing unit (CPU) can understand and execute. It defines the interface between software and hardware, specifying the operations that a CPU can perform, the data types it can manipulate, and the memory addressing modes it supports.

- **Risc-V ISA**
  - Risc-V ISA is an open-source ISA that has simpler and fixed length instructions that allows us to create custom processors for specific needs without being tied to proprietary architectures
 
- **Tools Used for the flow**
  - As we are aware of the flow, we will be using Risc-v ISA ALP and the RTL used will be picorv32a (We will be using rv64i during initial stages)

# Goal : Any High level Program that is written should be able to get executed in our CHIP

### List of well-known extensions present in Risc-V ISA

``` rv32i``` ``` rv64i``` ```rv32imc``` ```rv64imc``` ```rv32imafdc``` ```rv64imafdc``` ```rv32imcb``` ```rv64imcb``` ```rv32imc_sv32``` ```rv64gcv```

## BASICS :

Instructions that act on signed or unsigned integers are called Base Integer Instructions
There are 47 Base Integer Instructions present in RISC-V ISA

### Types of Instruction based on encoding format

1. **R-Type (Register-Type):**
   - These instructions operate on registers and have a fixed format for their operands.
   - Examples: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, SLL, SRL, SRA, SLT, SLTU

2. **I-Type (Immediate-Type):**
   - These instructions have an immediate operand and one register operand.
   - Examples: ADDI, SLTI, SLTIU, XORI, ORI, ANDI, SLLI, SRLI, SRAI, LB, LH, LW, LBU, LHU, JALR

3. **S-Type (Store-Type):**
   - These instructions are used for storing values from registers to memory.
   - Examples: SB, SH, SW

4. **B-Type (Branch-Type):**
   - These instructions perform conditional branching based on comparisons.
   - Examples: BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU

5. **U-Type (Upper Immediate-Type):**
   - These instructions have a larger immediate field for encoding larger constants.
   - Examples: LUI, AUIPC

6. **J-Type (Jump-Type):**
   - These instructions are used for unconditional jumps and function calls.
   - Examples: JAL

<img width="1000" height="420" alt="image" src="https://github.com/yagnavivek/PES_ASIC_CLASS/assets/93475824/e69043fb-684e-42eb-9e21-fd51943c1ec1">

**[number]** represents number of bits occupied by that field

1. **Opcode [7] :** The opcode is a field within a machine language instruction that indicates the operation to be performed by the instruction. It defines the type of operation, such as arithmetic, logic, memory access, or control flow. Opcodes are used by the CPU to determine how to execute the instruction.

2. **rd (Destination Register) [5]:** The "rd" field represents the destination register in an assembly language instruction. It indicates the register where the result of the operation will be stored. After executing the instruction, the computed value will be placed in this register.

3. **rs1 (Source Register 1) [5]:** The "rs1" field represents the first source register in an assembly language instruction. It indicates the register that holds the value used in the operation. For instructions that involve two operands, "rs1" typically corresponds to the first operand.

4. **rs2 (Source Register 2) [5]:** The "rs2" field represents the second source register in an assembly language instruction. It indicates the register that holds the value used in the operation. For instructions that involve three operands, "rs2" typically corresponds to the second operand.

5. **func7 and func3 (Function Fields)[7] [3]:** These fields further refine the operation specified by the opcode. The "func7" field is used to distinguish different variations of instructions within the same opcode category. The "func3" field is used to specify a more specific operation within the opcode category. Together, these fields allow for a finer level of instruction differentiation.

6. **imm (Immediate Value):** The "imm" field represents an immediate value that is part of the instruction. Immediate values are constants that are embedded within the instruction itself. They can be used for various purposes, such as specifying offsets, constants, or small data values directly within the instruction.


#### ABI : Application Binary Interface

The instructions generated by compiler using a target ISA can be accessed by OS and User directly
- The parts of ISA accessible to User : User ISA
- The parts of ISA accessible to OS : system ISA
The access is done using Sysytem calls with the help of ABI

==> If we want to access hardware resources of processor, it has to be done via registers using ABI(names)

### ABI Names : 
- ABI names for registers serve as a standardized way to designate the purpose and usage of specific registers within a software ecosystem. These names play a critical role in maintaining compatibility, optimizing code generation, and facilitating communication between different software components.

<img width="1000" height="600" src="https://github.com/yagnavivek/PES_ASIC_CLASS/assets/93475824/27d13974-1b70-4207-a2fb-05b232027323">

#### Data can be stored in register by 2 methods
1. Directly store in registers
2. Store into registers from memory

To store 64 bits of data from mem to reg, we use 8*8bit stores ie., m[0],m[1]......m[7]. 

- ___RISC-V uses Little Endian format to store the data ie., Least significant Byte is stored in m[0]___

## Simulate a C program using ABI function call (using registers) and execute 

The required program files are under day 2 folder

![6](https://github.com/madhumadhu1318/PES_ASIC_CLASS/assets/90201844/32d6563b-34a0-4b35-bf6f-8e4701945fd3)


![7](https://github.com/madhumadhu1318/PES_ASIC_CLASS/assets/90201844/334d937c-c4a2-40a5-b537-29227327ae3b)

Here we can observe that at 5th line, inorder to comute the result ,its going to the "load"  function

### Further we will see how to run a C program on on RISC-V CPU

- Input : C Program loaded into memory to RISC-V CPU in Hex format

CPU processes the contents of the memory and provides with output using iverilog 

- Risc-V CPU : ```Picorv32.v```
- Testbench for verification : ```testbench.v```
- Tool : ```iverilog```
- script : ```rv32im.sh``` : has the commands to get the c-program, ALP, converts into hex format, loads into memory of riscv cpu, passes it iverilog and provides the output

# Introduction to Yosys and Logic synthesis
## Introduction to yosys
Yosys is an synthesizer which is used to convert RTL to netlist

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/pes_asic_class/assets/142583979/c7c8c923-3756-4a5f-8d8e-bc1f197122c8)

**`netlist` is the representation of `DESIGN` in the form of standard cells present in `.lib`**

- To verify synthesis Netlist need to be fed to iverilog along with testbench
- vcd file generated from iverilog need to be fed to gtkwave simulator
- The output we get should be same as the output we got during RTL simulator

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/pes_asic_class/assets/142583979/cf9df685-8243-4b32-ba07-ca872e1abcb2)

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/pes_asic_class/assets/142583979/6b37c624-302d-4685-bbc8-37213c120baf)

## Introduction to logic synthesis
Logic synthesis is a vital step in digital circuit design where high-level descriptions of circuits are transformed into specific implementations using logic gates. It optimizes circuits for factors like performance, area, power, and cost. The process includes library mapping, optimization, technology mapping, timing analysis, and verification. It's an iterative process often done with specialized software tools, enabling efficient hardware design.

**.lib:** 
- Logic synthesis tools use a library of standard cells. These cells are predefined logic gates with different functionalities and characteristics
- It will also contain fast and slow version of same gate
### why fast and slow version of same gate?
Fast and slow versions of gates are essential in digital circuit design to balance between clock frequency and timing constraints. Fast gates have shorter propagation delays and are used to reduce setup and hold time violations, allowing for higher clock frequencies. Slow gates, with longer delays, can be used to intentionally slow down critical paths or address timing issues. The Tclk formula helps calculate the maximum clock frequency while considering these factors.

**Tclk formula:** ![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/pes_asic_class/assets/142583979/43cac247-0106-427a-a9f5-786f6aab2197)

- **t_setup:** The setup time is the minimum time before the clock edge when the input data must be stable.
- **t_hold:** The hold time is the minimum time after the clock edge during which the input data must remain stable.
- **t_propagation:** This term represents the propagation delay of the logic gates in the critical path.
- **Tcq:** This term represents the clock-to-q delay of the flip-flops or registers used in the design. It's often a fixed value based on the chosen flip-flop technology.

<summary>DAY 4 : Timing Libs, Hirearchical vs Flat Synthsis and Efficient Flop Coding Styles </summary>
<br>

# Introduction to timing dot libs
### sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

+ **sky130:** This indicates that the library is associated with the SkyWater 130nm process technology. Process technology refers to the manufacturing process used to create integrated circuits (ICs) and determines factors like transistor size and performance characteristics.
  
+ **fd_sc_hd:** These letters likely stand for different aspects of the library. "fd" might refer to "Foundation," suggesting that this library contains fundamental building blocks for digital IC design. "sc" could stand for "Standard Cells," which are pre-designed logic gates used in IC design. "hd" could refer to "high-density" libraries, which typically contain smaller, more compact cell designs for achieving higher logic density in ICs.
  
+ **tt_025C:** This part of the name could refer to the library's operating conditions or temperature and voltage settings. "tt" might stand for "typical temperature," and "025C" could refer to 25 degrees Celsius, a common temperature for IC specifications. These conditions are important for characterizing the library's performance.
  
+ **1v80:** This likely represents the supply voltage for the library. In this case, "1v80" indicates a supply voltage of 1.8 volts, which is a common voltage level for digital ICs.

### Libraries contain

+ **Standard Cells:** This library is likely to include a variety of standard cells, which are pre-designed building blocks for digital logic. Standard cells consist of logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, XOR), flip-flops, latches, multiplexers, and other fundamental digital components. These cells are characterized for the specific process technology (in this case, SkyWater 130nm) and operating conditions (temperature and voltage).
  
+ **Timing Information:** The library will provide timing information for each standard cell. This information includes parameters like propagation delay, setup time, hold time, and other timing characteristics. Designers use this data to ensure that signals propagate correctly through the logic gates.
  
+ **Power Characteristics:** Power consumption data is crucial for estimating the energy usage of a design. The library will typically include information on dynamic power (power consumed when the circuit is switching) and static power (power consumed when the circuit is idle).
  
+ **Pin and I/O Information:** The library will specify the input and output pins for each standard cell, including pin names, directions (input or output), and electrical characteristics.
  
+ **Library Files:** These library files often come in various formats, including Liberty (.lib) files, which contain detailed timing and power information, and Verilog models, which allow designers to use these standard cells in their digital designs.
  
+ **Characterization Data:** The library may include data characterizing how the standard cells perform under different operating conditions, including variations in temperature and supply voltage. This helps designers account for variability in their designs.
  
+ **Technology Files:** These files might also include information about the specific characteristics of the SkyWater 130nm process technology, such as transistor models, interconnect information, and other process-related data.

# Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis
### Hierarchical Synthesis
- Hierarchical synthesis involves dividing the design into logical modules or blocks and synthesizing each module separately.
- These modules can have their own hierarchies, and they communicate through well-defined interfaces
- It enhances reusability, as individual modules can be reused in other designs.
- Supports better scalability for large, complex designs.

### Steps to Hierarchical Synthesis
- Go to verilog_files directory
- once you get to verilog_files directory, Invoke yosys by using the command `yosys`
- once yosys is invoked follow the above sequence of commands
  ``` sh
  read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib  
  read_verilog multiple_modules.v
  synth -top multiple_modules
  abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
  show multiple_modules
  write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_hier.v
  !gvim multiple_modules_hier.v
  ```

### Flat Synthesis
- In flat synthesis, the entire design is synthesized as a single, monolithic entity.
- All modules, submodules, and logic are flattened into a single level of hierarchy.
- This means that all components, regardless of their intended functionality, are combined into a single giant netlist
- Best suited for simple designs where complexity is low and maintainability isn't a significant concern.

### Steps to Flat Synthesis
- Go to verilog_files directory
- once you get to verilog_files directory, Invoke yosys by using the command `yosys`
- once yosys is invoked follow the above sequence of commands
  ``` sh
  read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib  
  read_verilog multiple_modules.v
  synth -top multiple_modules
  abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
  flatten
  show
  write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_flat.v
  !gvim multiple_modules_flat.v
  ```

# Various Flop Coding Styles and optimization
## Flop coding styles
**Asynchronous Reset D Flip-Flop**
- When an asynchronous reset input is activated (set to '1'), regardless of the clock signal, the stored value is forced to '0'.
- Otherwise, on the positive edge of the clock signal, the stored value is updated with the data input.
### dff_asyncres_syncres.v
``` v
module dff_asyncres_syncres ( input clk , input async_reset , input sync_reset , input d , output reg q );
always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset)
begin
	if(async_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else if (sync_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
endmodule
```

**Asynchronous Set D Flip-Flop**
- When an asynchronous set input is activated (set to '1'), regardless of the clock signal, the stored value is forced to '1'.
- Otherwise, on the positive edge of the clock signal, the stored value is updated with the data input.
### dff_async_set.v
``` v
module dff_async_set ( input clk ,  input async_set , input d , output reg q );
always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_set)
begin
	if(async_set)
		q <= 1'b1;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
endmodule
```

**Synchronous Reset D Flip-Flop**
- When a synchronous reset input is activated (set to '1') at the positive edge of the clock signal, the stored value is forced to '0'.
- Otherwise, on the positive edge of the clock signal, the stored value is updated with the data input.
### dff_syncres.v
``` v
module dff_syncres ( input clk , input async_reset , input sync_reset , input d , output reg q );
always @ (posedge clk )
begin
	if (sync_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
endmodule
```

**D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Reset and Synchronous Reset**
- This flip-flop combines both asynchronous and synchronous reset features.
- When the asynchronous reset input is activated (set to '1'), the stored value is immediately forced to '0'.
- When the synchronous reset input is activated (set to '1') at the positive edge of the clock signal, the stored value is forced to '0'.
- Otherwise, on the positive edge of the clock signal, the stored value is updated with the data input.
### dff_asyncres_syncres.v
``` v
module dff_asyncres_syncres ( input clk , input async_reset , input sync_reset , input d , output reg q );
always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset)
begin
	if(async_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else if (sync_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
endmodule
